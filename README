Some performance tests of Neo4j and Neo4j.rb

The test creates a Neo4j Database by importing file information
from the filesystem. Then it calculates the total size of all
those files by traversing the tree in Neo4j.

There are three tests
* Running the traversal just using the Java API
* Running the traversal just using the Java API from JRuby
* Running the traversal using the Neo4j.rb wrapper

=== To Execute

  > bundle 
  > rake create
  > rake java  
  > rake jruby
  > rake wrapper
